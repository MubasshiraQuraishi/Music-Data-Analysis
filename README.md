I recently completed a data analysis project using a dataset from **Wise Owl Training**.

This project utilized **Python, SQL, and Power BI** to clean, analyze, and visualize musical data, including:  
- Creating 9 stored procedures in MySQL for dynamic queries (e.g., artist trends, album sales, and venue updates).  
- Building Power BI dashboards to visualize insights like revenue trends and artist performances.  

Python-SQL-Power BI integration is a game-changer, and Iâ€™m thrilled with the results!
